== Download and Installation ==

1. Download and extract attached archive. In the archive you will find  the following 2 folders: 
  *  Includes
  *  Modules

2. Copy those folders to your root folder of WHMCS. Files will be copied to corresponding directories.

3. Please go to 'Setup >Addon Modules' in your WHMCS Admin area and activate the addon. Then please click ‘Addons > NamecheapSSL Module addon’ or go to http://yourdomain.com/admin/addonmodules.php?module=namecheapssl (given you have WHMCS installed on http://yourdomain.com/). The SSL Module Addon installation is now complete.

== Setting up the Product and Configuration ==

To setup an SSL certificate product, please follow the steps below:

1. Create a product as normal - name, description, no domain options, etc.

2. Ensure the welcome email is set to "None" in the dropdown menu on the Details tab, as the module sends its own email.

3. In this version, the module billing cycles and SSL validity period are configured via standard WHMCS “Products/Services” settings. To access this, go to the _Pricing_ tab and select _Payment Type to Recurring_. Now disable _“One Time/Monthly”_, _“Quarterly”_ and _“Semi-Annualy”_ billing cycles since they are not applicable to SSL Certificates. Finally, specify prices for remaining billing cycles. _“Annually”_ corresponds to 1 year of SSL certificate validity (i.e. the SSL will be registered for 1 year). Biennially and triennially refer to 2 and 3 years respectively.

4. On the _Module Settings_ tab, choose _"Namecheapssl"_ from Module Name dropdown menu.

5. Enter your API credentials. If you wish to test this module in sandbox environment, make sure to enter your sandbox username, sandbox API key in the corresponding text fields. Also, be sure to check the _“Test Mode”_ box.

6. Choose the certificate type from the drop-down menu.

7. If you have a special _“Promotion Code”_, type it into the corresponding text field.

8. If _“Use existing SSL from account”_ option is checked we will try to use an existing SSL certificate of this type from your Namecheap account first. If there is no SSL available that can be used, a new certificate will be purchased.

9. The purpose of the next set of fields is to customize the *Technical Contact Details* for any purchased SSL Certificates (fields are shown on a screens shot below). By default, Namecheap Contact details are used (email address sslsupport@namecheap.com). Using a custom Technical Contact Details is useful for resellers who wish to appear as
an independent business entity to their customers. Depending on whether you want to use custom Technical Contact Details or not, perform the corresponding action:

  * In order to use *Default Technical Email* leave ALL of the fields below empty.
  * If you wish to use *Custom Technical Email* fill in ALL of the fields below.

  http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/customizing-technical-contact-details.jpg

*Note:* Our ability to provide support to customers who use custom **Technical Contact Fields** is limited. In case custom technical contact details are used, we cannot perform reissues, resending of approver email/ certificate, or cancellation/revocation of !GeoTrust and !VeriSign SSL Certificates. However, since you possess control over technical contact, you can access !GeoTrust/!VeriSign Live Account and perform these required actions yourself.

For control of !GeoTrust SSLs, please visit:
https://products.geotrust.com/orders/orderinformation/authentication.do

For control of !VeriSign SSLs, please visit:
https://products.verisign.com/orders/orderinformation/authentication.do


==== Multiple Years ====
Certificate validity periods are configured via billing cycles. See item #3 from the previous section for more information. 

==== The Order Process ====

The product will appear in the order process as a regular product which can be added to the cart. No configuration is performed before purchase. Once a certificate is purchased, paid for, and activated, the user is sent an email containing a link which takes them to configure the certificate in the client area. Once all details have been provided, the configuration data is sent to the Certificate Authority for validation. No manual intervention is required from you.

==== Certificate Configuration ====

You have an option to resend an email containing a link to the certificate configuration page to the client. This page is also
accessible from the client area (My Products & Services -> Product Details -> View Certificate Details). Options to resend
approver email and email with the certificate issued are also available in the client area.

==== Debugging Mode ====
Special debugging mode was added in release v 1.2. Enabling this mode will cause logging of all API related events using the NamecheapSSL Module Addon. Debugging mode is WHMCS products specific, so that you can activate it for specific products. Normally you should keep this mode disabled. Enable it only when advised by Namecheap Support team.
To enable it go to “Products/Services” settings and check the box “Debug Mode”:

  http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/debug-mode.jpg

Now all Namecheap API related events will be logged by NamecheapSSL Moduleaddon:

  http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/namecheapssl-addon.jpg

==== Welcome/Configuration Email ====
On its first launch, Namecheap SSL module automatically creates a configuration email template (see “SSL Certificate Configuration Required” in section "Product Messages" of **Email Templates** in **Setup**). It contains link to activation process inside your client area for a specific SSL certificate.

Sending of SSL Configuration Email is controlled by the following parameters:

Type of product setup behavior in Module Settings tab:

http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/product-setup-behaviour-type.jpg

1. Configuration email is always sent for options “Automatically setup the product as soon as an order is placed” and “Automatically setup the product as soon as the first payment is received”. If you select “Automatically setup the product as soon as an order is placed”, a configuration email will only be sent if the order is placed from the client area. The module itself will run only if you place the order from client area as well.

2. If the options “Automatically setup the product when you manually accept a pending order” or “Do not automatically setup this product” are selected, then sending of the Configuration Email will depend on the box “Send Welcome Email”:

  http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/welcome-email.jpg


You can modify content of the configuration email at any time. 

==== Renewal ====

In version 1.1.4 and above, renewal functionality is fully integrated into the module. As long as you have “Payment Type” set to “Recurring” when creating a product, invoices for renewals will be generated automatically. Once paid, renewal SSLs will be created automatically as well. Please keep in mind that after the renewal SSL is created, it still requires activation using [http://namecheap.simplekb.com/kb.show?show=article&articleid=817&categoryid=71 renewal CSR].
 
==== Renew SSL Certificates Created with Previous Versions of the Module ====

Should you need to renew an SSL certificate purchased with a previous version of the module, please ask your clients to place
a new order when the certificate is due for renewal and use [http://namecheap.simplekb.com/kb.show?show=article&articleid=817&categoryid=71 renewal CSR] during configuration.

==== Reissue ====
Go to ‘Clients Profile > Products and Services’

  http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/reissue-certificate.jpg

Clicking reissue will send an email to a customer with a subject ‘SSL Certificate Reissue Invitation’. The email contains a link to proceed with reissue.
Certificate status changes to ‘Awaiting configuration’.
‘Reissue Certificate’ is also available from customer’s end in client 
area. This feature is shown for active certificates only:

  http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/reissue-comodo-certificate.jpg

Clicking this button makes all _Comodo_ certificates status change to ‘Awaiting configuration’; as for other brands, you will be redirected to a corresponding certificate authority reissue page. 
To complete the process, please follow the instructions from the confirmation email sent by a certificate authority.
Reissuing a certificate will change its Namecheap Certificate ID. A new certificate record will be added to your Namecheap account.

----
<font size=3px>* Note:*</font> <font size=2.5px>_ If you try pressing ‘Reissue Certificate’ button for Symantec certificates, you will have an error returned. Please just encourage your customer to reissue the certificate by the link in error message_</font>

==== Synchronize due date and reissue state ====
All changes done in WHMCS are synchronized with your Namecheap account automatically once a day (when WHMCS cron runs). Also you can perform manual synchronization any time by clicking ‘Synchronize due date and reissue state’. This will set WHMCS due dates and reissue states in sync with Namecheap admin area when needed:

  http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/sync-due-date-and-reissue.jpg

==== View Details ====
Now you can also view certificate details from a client’s profile ‘Products and Services’ tab.

  http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/view-details.jpg

Here you can check certificate status, status descriptions, certificate type, view CSR in raw format and decoded, see issuance and expiration date, etc.

  http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/view-csr-details.jpg

Each successful operation is confirmed by ‘Module Command Success’ message.

<font size=3px>* Note:*</font> <font size=2.5px>_In case you face any errors with synchronizing old certificates or viewing their info – please submit a ticket with our support team. There is a solution for it ,but it is not yet fully stable so it is not documented here. _</font>
