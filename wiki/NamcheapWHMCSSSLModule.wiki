== Download and Installation ==
1. [http://code.google.com/p/namecheap/downloads/list Download] the latest plugin (namecheapssl-whmcs-versionX.X.X.zip) archive and extract it.

2. Create a folder called **namecheapssl** under Modules/Servers in your WHMCS root directory and paste the content of the downloaded **archive** inside the folder (i.e. files viewdetails.tpl, no_approver.tpl, namecheapssl.php, namecheapapi.php and fodlerlang). The SSL module installation is complete.
== Setting up the Product and Configuration ==

To setup an SSL certificate product, please follow the steps below:

1. Create a product as normal - name, description, no domain options, etc.

2. Ensure the welcome email is set to "None" in the dropdown menu on the Details tab, as the module sends its own email.

3. In this version, the module billing cycles and SSL validity period are configured via standard WHMCS “Products/Services” settings. To access this, go to the _Pricing_ tab and select _Payment Type to Recurring_. Now disable _“One Time/Monthly”_, _“Quarterly”_ and _“Semi-Annualy”_ billing cycles since they are not applicable to SSL Certificates. Finally, specify prices for remaining billing cycles. _“Annually”_ corresponds to 1 year of SSL certificate validity (i.e. the SSL will be registered for 1 year). Biennially and triennially refer to 2 and 3 years respectively.

4. On the _Module Settings_ tab, choose _"Namecheapssl"_ from Module Name dropdown menu.

5. Enter your API credentials. If you wish to test this module in sandbox environment, make sure to enter your sandbox username, sandbox API key in the corresponding text fields. Also, be sure to check the _“Test Mode”_ box.

6. Choose the certificate type from the drop-down menu.

7. If you have a special _“Promotion Code”_, type it into the corresponding text field.

8. If _“Use existing SSL from account”_ option is checked we will try to use an existing SSL certificate of this type from your Namecheap account first. If there is no SSL available that can be used, a new certificate will be purchased.

9. The purpose of the next set of fields is to customize the *Technical Contact Details* for any purchased SSL Certificates (fields are shown on a screens shot below). By default, Namecheap Contact details are used (email address sslsupport@namecheap.com). Using a custom Technical Contact Details is useful for resellers who wish to appear as
an independent business entity to their customers. Depending on whether you want to use custom Technical Contact Details or not, perform the corresponding action:

  * In order to use *Default Technical Email* leave ALL of the fields below empty.
  * If you wish to use *Custom Technical Email* fill in ALL of the fields below.

http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/customizing-technical-contact-details.jpg

*Note:* Our ability to provide support to customers who use custom **Technical Contact Fields** is limited. In case custom technical contact details are used, we cannot perform reissues, resending of approver email/ certificate, or cancellation/revocation of GeoTrust and VeriSign SSL Certificates. However, since you possess control over technical contact, you can access GeoTrust/VeriSign Live Account and perform these required actions yourself.

For control of GeoTrust SSLs, please visit:

For control of VeriSign SSLs, please visit:
https://products.verisign.com/orders/orderinformation/authentication.do


==== Multiple Years ====
In this version of the module, certificate validity periods are configured via billing cycles. See item #3 from the previous section
for more information.

*Note:* If there are any _Configurable Options_ left from any previous versions of the Namecheap SSL Module, please delete
them as they may cause errors.

==== The Order Process ====

The product will appear in the order process as a regular product which can be added to the cart. No configuration is performed before purchase. Once a certificate is purchased, paid for, and activated, the user is sent an email containing a link which takes them to configure the certificate in the client area. Once all details have been provided, the configuration data is sent to the Certificate Authority for validation. No manual intervention is required from you.

==== Certificate Configuration ====

You have an option to resend an email containing a link to the certificate configuration page to the client. This page is also
accessible from the client area (My Products & Services -> Product Details -> View Certificate Details). Options to resend
approver email and email with the certificate issued are also available in the client area.

==== Welcome/Configuration Email ====
On its first launch, Namecheap SSL module automatically creates a configuration email template (see “ SSL Certificate Configuration Required” in section "Product Messages" of **Email Templates** in **Setup**). It contains link to activation process inside your client area for a specific SSL certificate.

Sending of SSL Configuration Email is controlled by the following parameters:

Type of product setup behavior in Module Settings tab:

http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/product-setup-behaviour-type.jpg

1. Configuration email is always sent for options “Automatically setup the product as soon as an order is placed” and “Automatically setup the product as soon as the first payment is received”.

2. If the options “Automatically setup the product when you manually accept a pending order” or “Do not automatically setup this product” are selected, then sending of the Configuration Email will depend on the box “Send Welcome Email”:

You can modify content of the configuration email at any time. 

==== Renewal ====

In version 1.1.4 and above, renewal functionality is fully integrated into the module. As long as you have “Payment Type” set to “Recurring” when creating a product, invoices for renewals will be generated automatically. Once paid, renewal SSLs will be created automatically as well. Please keep in mind that after the renewal SSL is created, it still requires activation using [http://namecheap.simplekb.com/kb.show?show=article&articleid=817&categoryid=71 renewal CSR].
 
==== Renew SSL Certificates Created with Previous Versions of the Module ====

Should you need to renew an SSL certificate purchased with a previous version of the module, please ask your clients to place
a new order when the certificate is due for renewal and use [http://namecheap.simplekb.com/kb.show?show=article&articleid=817&categoryid=71 renewal CSR] during configuration.
