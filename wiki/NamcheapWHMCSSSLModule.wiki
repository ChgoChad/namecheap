Namecheap has a production as well as a test server environment. The test server environment is called Sandbox. We urge you to test the plug-in in our [http://www.sandbox.namecheap.com/ sandbox environment], before pointing it to production. It uses same calls as our production environment except that you will not receive actual SSL product in the end of the process. Difference between setting product for Sandbox and for production will be described in Setting products section.

Comodo CA does not provide test environment for their products so only Symantec certificate can be activated from sandbox:

===Download and installation===
Installation of module will not take a lot of time:

1. Download and extract attached archive. It can be downloaded here: [https://code.google.com/p/namecheap/downloads/detail?name=namecheap_ssl_140.zip&can=2&q=].  Copy the contents to the root folder of whmcs (folder structure will remain the same).  

2. Go to 'Setup >Addon Modules' in your WHMCS Admin area and activate the addon. Then go here:

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/ssl-module-addon-installation.png]

The SSL Module Addon installation is now complete.
----
Important Note: 

If you receive any errors or cannot access http://yourdomain.com/admin/addonmodules.php?module=namecheap_ssl please set up access rights to addon for everyone as on screenshot:

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Access%20Rights.png]
 
----
===Setting products, pricings===

To setup an SSL certificate product, please follow the steps below:

1. Create a new product within your WHMCS.

2. Ensure the welcome email is set to "None" in the dropdown menu on the Details tab, as the module sends its own email.

3. In this version, the module billing cycles and SSL validity period are configured via standard WHMCS “Products/Services” settings. To access this, go to the Pricing tab and select Payment Type to Recurring. Now disable _“One Time/Monthly”_, _“Quarterly”_ and _“Semi-Annualy”_ billing cycles since they are not applicable to SSL Certificates. Finally, specify prices for remaining billing cycles. _“Annually”_ corresponds to 1 year of SSL certificate validity (i.e. the SSL will be registered for 1 year). Biennially and triennially refer to 2 and 3 years respectively.

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Product-Settings.png]

 
4. On the _Module Settings_ tab, choose _"Namecheapssl"_ from Module Name dropdown menu.

5. Enter your API credentials. If you wish to test this module in sandbox environment, make sure to enter your sandbox username, sandbox API key in the corresponding text fields. Also, be sure to check the _“Test Mode”_ box.

6. Choose the certificate type from the drop-down menu.

7. If you have a special _“Promotion Code”_, type it into the corresponding text field.

8. If _“Use existing SSL from account”_ option is checked we will try to use an existing SSL certificate of this type from your Namecheap account first. If there is no SSL available that can be used, a new certificate will be purchased.

9. The purpose of the next set of fields is to customize the Technical Contact Details for any purchased SSL Certificates (fields are shown on a screens shot below). By default, Namecheap Contact details are used (email address sslsupport@namecheap.com). Using a custom Technical Contact Details is useful for resellers who wish to appear as an independent business entity to their customers. Depending on whether you want to use custom Technical Contact Details or not, perform the corresponding action:
  * In order to use *Default Technical Email* leave ALL of the fields below empty.
  * If you wish to use *Custom Technical Email* fill in ALL of the fields below.

http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Customizing-TechnicalContacts.png
 
Note: Our ability to provide support to customers who use custom Technical Contact Fields is limited. In case custom technical contact details are used, we cannot perform reissues, resending of approver email/ certificate, or cancellation/revocation of GeoTrust and VeriSign SSL Certificates. However, since you possess control over technical contact, you can access GeoTrust/VeriSign Live Account and perform these required actions yourself.

For control of !GeoTrust SSLs, please visit: https://products.geotrust.com/orders/orderinformation/authentication.do

For control of !VeriSign SSLs, please visit: https://products.verisign.com/orders/orderinformation/authentication.do

*The Order Process*

The product will appear in the order process as a regular product which can be added to the cart. No configuration is performed before purchase. Once a certificate is purchased, paid for, and activated, the user is sent an email containing a link which takes them to configure the certificate in the client area. Once all details have been provided, the configuration data is sent to the Certificate Authority for validation. No manual intervention is required from you.

You have an option to resend an email containing a link to the certificate configuration page to the client. This page is also accessible from the client area (My Products & Services -> Product Details -> View Certificate Details). Options to resend approver email and email with the certificate issued are also available in the client area.

*Welcome/Configuration Email*

On its first launch, Namecheap SSL module automatically creates a configuration email template (see “SSL Certificate Configuration Required” in section "Product Messages" of Email Templates in Setup). It contains link to activation process inside your client area for a specific SSL certificate.

Sending of SSL Configuration Email is controlled by the following parameters:

Type of product setup behavior in Module Settings tab:

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Module-Settings.png]
 

1. Configuration email is always sent for options “Automatically setup the product as soon as an order is placed” and “Automatically setup the product as soon as the first payment is received”. If you select “Automatically setup the product as soon as an order is placed”, a configuration email will only be sent if the order is placed from the client area. The module itself will run only if you place the order from client area as well.

2. If the options “Automatically setup the product when you manually accept a pending order” or “Do not automatically setup this product” are selected, then sending of the Configuration Email will depend on the box “Send Welcome Email”:

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Welcome-Email-Setting.png]
 

You can modify content of the configuration email at any time.

=== Activation from WHMCS ===

In order to activate certificate of yours you need to access list of your services and click on ‘View Details’ button next to ordered certificate.

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/View-Certificate-Details.png]
 

After that you need to click ‘View certificate details’ and ‘Configure certificate’.

You will see window with SSL activation fields: 

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Configuring-SSL-Certificate.png] 

At this stage you need to input CSR code (obtained from web-server), select web-server type and fill in valid admin contact info.

Basically admin contact info is to be taken from customer info in WHMCS.

In case CSR code is ok, you will receive the list of approval emails to select. One of those emails is to be selected in order to receive validation email there: it is needed for certificate issuance. 

Further activation process is between you or your customer and Certificate Authority. You are to receive approval email (for most certificates except Symantec OV and EV certs) and to approve it. After that certificate is to be sent to you (within 10-15 mins) or some docs request is to be sent to you for OV or EV certs.

=== Debugging and Addon functions===

While setting product you may check ‘Debug mode’ box in order to have your actions with module logged (highly recommended): 
 
[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Enabling-Debug-Mode.png]

This will allow you to check log of actions performed by module in addons section in WHMCS:

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Enabling-Log.png]

There you will find all of the actions performed by your customer with namecheapssl products, all hook actions and all API calls and responses. This is very convenient for investigation of possible issues.

Each action will have WHMCS service ID of certificate that was viewed/activated/reissued from WHMCS user area so you will be able to track actions of your customers.

*Link/Re-Link WHMCS Cert ID to NC Cert ID*

This feature allows fetching WHMCS certificate record with Namecheap certificate.

For this you will need to input WHMCS invoice ID given after order placement to corresponding box and then to input certID of an existing certificate within your NC account (can be found next to certificate in list of SSLs at Namecheap).

After clicking ‘Sync’ details for specific certificate in your WHMCS will be taken from Namecheap.


*Certificate List*

Here you may check certificates in all of the NC user accounts that have Namecheapssl products set up for them in your WHMCS.

You will see the following fields in the lists:

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Certificate-list.png]									
									

===Reissue and renewal===

Reissue and renewal are 2 different actions with SSL certificate.

Reissue is the process of having Comodo certificate regenerated with Certificate Authority if needed. For example, if you have lost your Private Key. For that you need to view details of your certificate from list of certificates in WHMCS user area and click ‘Reissue Certificate’ button:

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Reissuing-Cerificate.png]
 

Further process will be very similar to activation – you will need to paste CSR for same domain name and select approval email. Reissuing a certificate will change its Namecheap Certificate ID. A new certificate record will be added to your Namecheap account.

----
*Important Note:*
If you try pressing ‘Reissue Certificate’ button for Symantec certificates, you will have an error returned. Please just encourage your customer to reissue the certificate by the link in error message
----

*Synchronize due date and reissue state*

All changes done in WHMCS are synchronized with your Namecheap account automatically once a day (when WHMCS cron runs). Also you can perform manual synchronization any time by clicking ‘Synchronize due date and reissue state’. This will set WHMCS due dates and reissue states in sync with Namecheap admin area when needed:

[http://files.namecheap.com/images/googlecode/Sync-duedate-reissuestatus.png]

*Renewal* is pretty much the same as purchasing new certificate with Namecheap. Renewal functionality is fully integrated into the module. As long as you have “Payment Type” set to “Recurring” when creating a product, invoices for renewals will be generated automatically. Once paid, renewal SSLs will be created automatically as well. Please keep in mind that after the renewal SSL is created, it still requires activation using [http://namecheap.simplekb.com/kb.show?show=article&articleid=817&categoryid=71 renewal CSR].


===FAQ===

*Q:* I cancel certificate and nothing happens

*A:* Cancellation is being performed only in your WHMCS, but not in our system. Please submit a cancellation request with our SSL support team for certificate to be revoked and refunded


*Q:* Does your module support multi-language?

*A:* Yes, multi-language is fully integrated with WHMCS so you may change the default language of your WHMCS and language will be changed in fields used in module as well.

*Q:* Getting # An error occured: _[3022295]_ Invalid Approveremail: !ErrorDetails -4: The value of the 'loginPassword' argument is invalid! #  or other similar errors while activation of PositiveSSL (or any other Comodo one) in Sandbox

*A:* Our Sandbox environment does not support Comodo certificates as Comodo do not provide Sandbox environment to us. 

*Q:* Getting “ _[2010167]_ Parameter Years is Missing” error while accepting order.

*A:* This error usually occurs when Pricing is set up inproperly for your SSL product. Please doublecheck that Payment type is set to ‘Recurring’ and there is ‘-1’ input in ‘Monhtly, Quarterly, and Semi-Anually’ fields to disable possibility of ordering SSL for terms less than a year as SSL certificates can only be ordered and issed for a whole number of years only. 

*Q:* I receive 'An error occured: Invalid phone number or phone country code' error while activation of SSL certificate via your WHMCS module!

*A:* Please doublecheck that you have the valid information input in Phone (please pay attention to Phone number format) and Zip-code fields in both Admin contact info and in Technical Contact info (in product settings) . 

*Q:* I am receiving ''['" or any other strange characters instead or error messages while activation of my renewal certificate

*A:* This is a known bug, our developers are currently investigating it. In case you face this issue please email details at sslsupport@namecheap.com and kindly purchase and activate renewal certificate manually from Namecheap if renewal is urgent. After purchasing certificate manually you will need to sync the IDs using ‘Link/Re-Link WHMCS Cert ID to NC Cert ID’ addon function.
